    <p class="text-gray-700">
        Once upon a quantum fluctuation, a passionate human named <strong>Liam</strong> decided that physics didn't need to be boring, scary, or written in hieroglyphics only decipherable by Nobel Prize winners.
        So he did what any rational person would do: built an entire platform from scratch, styled it with Tailwind CSS, sprinkled animated particles across spacetimes, and brought an army of AI-powered tutor bots into existence.

    </p>
    <ul class="text-left list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Liam</strong> — Founder, developer, quantum dreamer, gradient enthusiast, accidental particle summoner.</li>
        <li><strong>EntangleBot™</strong> — AI tutor specialising in confusing metaphors and spooky action at a distance.</li>
        <li><strong>DecoherenceBot™</strong> — Dramatic, emotionally unstable, probably in a superposition of productivity and chaos.</li>
        <li><strong>MathBot™</strong> — Would love to teach you math, but will go off on wild tangent derivations no one asked for.</li>
